# Twitter-Bot
<p align="left">

Twitter-Bot is an automation bot using Tweepy Module with Python. This replaces the use of Twitter API as it is costly and takes much time to get access to. You can use it to post tweets, like tweets, and retweet and reply based on hashtags.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/Twitter_Bot.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Twitter-Bot ``` 
4. Run ``` pip3 install tweepy ```
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  
6. Apply for elevated access on Twitter playground.
7. Extract the ```Bearer Token and Access Token and Secret keys``` created with Read, Write, and Direct Messages permissions.
8.Copy them and paste in the required portion of the code (authentication part)
